A web &amp; mobile approach to monitor patient suffering from diabetes 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This work focuses on the development of a software solution to improve the control and prevention of certain chronic diseases . In this sense , we have designed a platform that allows you to monitor patients with diseases that have this feature, and implement health prevention campaigns in a supervised way . Specifically , on this platform , we have implemented a particular solution for the monitoring of diabetic and hypertensive patients.
According to the World Health Organization in the world there are over 220 million people with diabetes , about 80 % of diabetes deaths occur in countries of low and middle income , and its complications have a significant economic impact on those who suffer . Just as diabetes , other diseases that are considered NCD (Non -communicable Diseases or communicable diseases) that affect much to the world population. Among them may be mentioned cardiovascular diseases and chronic respiratory diseases.
The middle and low income are the most affected . Growing in public health centers demand , shortage of hospital resources , both financial and human , are factors that make control and prevention difficult by the volume of people that must be addressed daily.
In addition to diseases that affect so globalized the world's population , our country occur in regions of particular conditions that lead to the existence of its own conditions of each province or sector, such as Dengue or Chagas disease .
The objective of this study is to provide a partial solution to this problem by proposing the introduction of information technology and communication in process control and care of patients. These technologies provide the ability to monitor patients in early stages of prevention, distance , minimizing the flow of people in health centers , and on the other hand , supporting medical professionals for monitoring and evaluation of patients . Likewise, information dissemination mechanisms for primary health prevention are considered, making use of introductory level they currently have mobile phones and the Internet , linking these to other traditional technologies such as database engines .
The proposed solution and the technologies used are presented , pointing out the advantages and disadvantages that we have found to work long and mentioning extensions and improvements identified .
